Command line Finder-labelling tools
===================================

I couldn't find an easy way to get at the finder label colours from the
command line, so I wrote these two short command line tools to do so.

The first, getlabel, takes a list of filenames and outputs a list of
label colours.  The second, setlabel, takes a single filename and a colour
and sets the label for that file.

There are two scripts included in this archive that show one way to
use the tools to store Finder label colours in Subversion repositories.
To store the colours, you just do

  svn-save-labels

and then commit the changes.  To restore them after an update, simply run

  svn-restore-labels

The label colours are stored as versioned properties (the property name is
"mac:colour") in the repository.

Anyway, I hope someone finds these useful (I'm sure they will).

Regards to all,

Alastair
